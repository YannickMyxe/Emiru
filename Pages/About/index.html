        The name <div class="tooltip"><b>Emiru(えみる - エミル)</b>
          <span class="tooltiptext">Litarly means <i>'E - mi - ru'</i> in Hiragana and Katakana</span>
        </div>  was chosen in honour of a friend, it has a soft and smooth sound to it and the name sticked in our head, the creation of Emiru was born. Emiru was designed in the first place to let people freely learn Japanese and now it also involves the culture of it.
      </p>
        <p><b>Keep in mind this is still work in progress!</b><br><br>Emiru is a web based Japanese Language and Culture Learner. We give you the means to learn all about Japan, here you can practice your Japanese. We have devided each subject into <i>Lessons</i>, each lesson you will learn something new and after each lesson you can practice the newly learned terms. Emiru might give you the means of learning Japanese, but if you dont repeat the lessons you won't be able to rember all your terms, so keep repeating, keep practicing and you will definately be able to learn and speak some Japanese. Rember it's not about how much you learn, it's about the consistency.<br>
