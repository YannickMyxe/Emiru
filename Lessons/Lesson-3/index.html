                <p>
                    In the japanese Language you have many Personal pronouns. As seen in Lesson 2 you have the Personal pronoun 
                    <i id="watashi">Watashi</i> and <i>Anata</i> both respectivly mean <i>I</i> and <i>You</i>. <br>
                    <p class="title">Talking about yourself: I</p>
                    <b>Watashi</b> is the most common form to say <i>I</i>, but there are many more ways to say I in Japanese.
                    This greatly depends who you are speaking to, it depends on their age, gender and level(to be in higher command than you, like a teacher or your boss). <br>
                    <b>Watakushi</b> is the most formal way to say, you would use this in very formal conversations or when you speak against someone that has a greater position than you.<br>
                    <b>Waga</b> is used to express <i>My</i> or <i>Our</i> Like in: Waga-kuni(our country). <br>
                    <b>Ore</b> is an informal way used mostly by men to express a sense of masculinity, it's also used to express their own status when talking to youger or people with a lower status. 
                    It can also be used with close friends but this now doesn't mean masculinity or stutus anymore, it now stands for <i>Familiarity</i>.<br>
                    <b>Boku</b> is used by males of all ages. It is most commonly found with youger children and when more older people use it it can be a tone of feeling young.<br>
                    <b>Jibun</b> means litarly oneself.<br>
                    <b>atashi</b> can be used as an informal female <i>Watashi</i>. It's rarely used in written Language, but espacialy used by younger females.<br>
                    <b>Uchi</b> means <i>One's own</i>, mostly used by femals in informal conversations. It is used by both genders when talking about houshold possesions like <i>Uchi no neko</i> >> My / our cat. For the seperation of My and our you will need to look at the context.<br>
                    <b>Your own name</b> is mostly used by little children, it is described as cute and childish. Try to avoid this in fromal conversations, this would make you defenitly look childish.<br>
                    <b>Oira</b> is a more casual form of <i>Ore</i> and is more used with people from a more rural background.<br>
                    
                    
                    <p class="title">Talking about someone else: you</p>
                    <b>Anata</b> is the most common way to say <i>You</i>.<br>
                    <b>Name + honorific</b> is the most common and the best way to adress someone you are speaking to. It can be used in formal and informal ways according to its honorific. Example: Emriu San >> Mr / Mrs Emiru. San is the most common honorific it can be used for both genders and it's closest translation in English is Mr, Mrs, Miss ... More on honorifics later this lesson.<br>
                    <b>anta</b> this expresses anger or Familiarity towards a person. It can be seen as very rude and it makes you seem uneducated if used a Formal conversation.<br>                  
                    <b>Kimi</b> is best used in informal conversations, in informal conversations, against a stranger or against elderly this can seem rude. Kimi is in general mostly used with the honorific <i>-Kun</i>.<br>
                    <b>Kika</b> is used as an informal way to speak to a younger person.<br>
                    <b>Kikan</b> not to be mixed up with the upper mensioned <i>kika</i>. Kikan is used to speak to goverment officials, the army etc<br>  
                    
                    
                    <p class="title">Talking about someone else: He / she</p>
                    These can be used for both genders.<br>
                    <b>Ano hito</b> used in both informal and formal conversations. Litarly means 'that person'.<br>
                    <b>yatsu</b> used in very informal conversations, like the words <i>Guy</i> and <i>Dude</i> in English.<br>
                    <b>koitsu - koyatsu</b> is used for a person or material near the speaker. 'this one'.<br>
                    <b>soitsu - soyatsu</b> is used for a person or material near the listener. 'that one'.<br>
                    <b>aitsu - ayatsu</b> is used for a person and less commonly used for a meterial far from both the speaker and listener. 'that one' or 'that one over there'<br>


                    <p class="title">Talking about someone else: He</p>
                    <b>Kare</b> can be used as an infromal way, but can also mean boyfriend. Kareshi used to be equivelent to kare but this now always means boyfriend.
                    <br><br>
