            <p>This lesson is about the Japanese Alphabet.<Br>The Japanese Language, unklike the rest of most western languages, doesn't use the traditional A-Z characters instead
            you have 3 kind of writing systems (actualy 4(Romanji) but the 4th one is just the Western Alphabet): <br><br>
            <ul class="no-bullets">
                <li><a href="#Kanji"    class="light-btn">Kanji</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Katakana" class="light-btn">Katakana</a></li>
                <li><a href="#Hiragana" class="light-btn">Hiragana</a></Li>
            </ul>
            Now nowing how the Japanes writing system works, we can now look in more detail to them, but first of all,<i>"Wich writing system should i learn first?"</i>. This is a very common question and the awnser is pretty simple, it doesn't realy matter, but still there is a better way of learning the Japanese Language.
            First of all you should probably learn Hiragana since this is one of easyer ones. This is mosly uses for non Japanese origion words, like computers etc.
            This is also used to show people how to pronounce a Kanji (Most of the time this is used when a new Kanji is introduced). Altough the writing systems don't uses spaces, comma's, points and questionmarks, they sometimes are added to make it easyer to read (this is mostly done to not native Japanese speakers)
            <br><br>
            <span class="content-header" id="Kanji">Kanji:</span><br>
            In kanji each character has their own meaning, unlike the western languages where we use letters to make a word, 
            this means that <i>"tree"</i>(木) and <i>"father"</i>(父) have their own unike character. In the western languages we make up the words using letters instead of unique characters, this is also true for the other 2 Japanes writing systems.
            A single character in Kanji is simply called Kanji.<br>
            Examples:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>明, meaning clear - bright - light</li>
                <li>酒, meaning sake(Alcoholic drink)</li>
                <li>水, meaning water</li>
            </ul><br>
